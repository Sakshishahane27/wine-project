# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Wine Quality Prediction App

## Step 1: Open Terminal
- Look at the bottom panel of VS Code (the terminal)
- Make sure you see: `PS C:\Users\Sakshi\Desktop\wine project>`

## Step 2: Stop Any Running App (if needed)
- If you see Streamlit running, press: `Ctrl + C`
- Press it again if needed
- Wait until you see the prompt: `PS C:\Users\Sakshi\Desktop\wine project>`

## Step 3: Run the App
- Type this EXACT command:
  ```
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
- Press **Enter**

## Step 4: Complete Streamlit Setup
- You will see: `Welcome to Streamlit! Email:`
- Simply press **Enter** (to skip email) OR type `n` and press Enter
- Wait 5-10 seconds

## Step 5: Find the URL
- Look in the terminal for this line:
  ```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  ```

## Step 6: Open in Browser
- **Copy this URL**: `http://localhost:8501`
- Open a **NEW browser tab** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)
- Paste the URL in the address bar
- Press **Enter**

## Step 7: You Should See
- ✅ Wine Quality Prediction System header
- ✅ Navigation sidebar with 3 pages
- ✅ Prediction page with input fields

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
- **Use port 8501** (NOT 5500)
- Port 5500 shows a file list (wrong!)
- Port 8501 shows your app (correct!)
- Warnings in terminal are OK - ignore them!

## ❌ If It Doesn't Work:
1. Make sure you're using `http://localhost:8501` (not 5500)
2. Check terminal for error messages (not warnings)
3. Try closing browser and opening again
4. Make sure Streamlit is still running in terminal
